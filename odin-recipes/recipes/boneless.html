  <h2>Recipe description</h2>
  <p>These boneless wings are a great way to have chicken. I had these at a pub and fell in love with the taste. They're a nice change from your regular chicken wings. Serve with blue cheese dressing for dipping.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpouse flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2 inch strips</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hot pepper sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients and heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double-coated. Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).    </li>
    <li>Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
